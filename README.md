# ATProto Science

ATProto Science is about using [ATProto](https://atproto.com/) for science applications, such as publishing, curation, data sharing or social discourse around research.


## What we do

Examples of some themes weâ€™re interested include:

- Exploring the use of ATProto for new kinds of science publishing and communication (such as Nanopublications or Discourse Graphs)
- New kinds of social networks for researchers (like [Cosmik](https://cosmik.network/)),
- Building better research feeds on Bluesky (like [Paper Skygest](https://bsky.app/profile/paper-feed.bsky.social))
- AI for science on ATProto (such as https://hypgen.ai/)
- Tools for thought (such as https://groundmist.xyz/)
- Hosting science infrastructure on ATProto

And generally understanding what tools and services would be useful for research communities on Bluesky/ATProto.
